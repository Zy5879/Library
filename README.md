# Library

THOUGHTS

MY MOTIVATION FOR THIS PROJECT WAS TO REINFORCE THE INFORMATION THAT I HAVE BEEN LEARNING ABOUT OBJECT
AND OBJECT CONSTRUCTORS PLUS IMPROVING UPON EVERYTHING THAT
I HAVE BEEN LEARNING IN JS. THIS LIBRARY 'APP' STORES INFORMATION THAT A USER INPUTS INTO A CARD.

IN THE FUTURE, I WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE UPON THIS PROJCET AS I CONTINUE TO LEARN MORE AND MORE.
